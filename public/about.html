<p>I am a web developer with a strong interest in building modern, impactful websites for emerging brands. With over five years of experience as a front-end developer, I specialize in creating clean, responsive, and user-focused digital experiences. My background in design principles and modern development practices enables me to deliver websites that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance and usability.</p>

<p>Before transitioning into tech, I began my career as a pharmacist in Nigeria, gaining more than four years of experience across community, hospital, and industrial practice. In 2022, I relocated to the United Kingdom to pursue a Master’s degree in Pharmacology and Drug Discovery, graduating with distinction. During my studies, I developed competencies in computational structural modeling, an essential component of modern drug development, as well as hands-on expertise in key laboratory research techniques.</p>

<p>Alongside my academic and technical journey, I have worked within the UK healthcare system as a Support Worker with IBC Healthcare, caring for individuals with learning disabilities, epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. This experience strengthened my empathy, communication, and critical problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>Today, I combine my multidisciplinary background in technology, science, and healthcare to bring a unique perspective to web development. I am actively expanding my technical expertise with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer, deepening my knowledge in backend technologies and modern frameworks. I am passionate about helping rising brands establish a strong digital presence while continuing to grow as a versatile and innovative developer.</p>
